# MM-BookNook

Welcome to M&M's Book Nook.
As passionate readers we personally own an enormous collection of books.
To streamline our book management, we've developed a feature-rich program designed to catalogue our beloved books.

Our program boasts a secure login and registration system, enhanced by face detection technology. This ensures that the program only activates in the presence of a human face, adding an extra layer of security and convenience to your book cataloging experienceThis prevents our pet otter and squirel from accessing the program and manipulating our priceless book data by randomly pressing keys. 
It also works well in preventing robbers in ski masks from accessing our precious book data.


If you are also a passionate book collector and connoisseur this program is the perfect tool to help you organize information about each of your exquisite pieces of litterature.

Sincerly,
M & M
