# MM-BookNook

Welcome to M&M's Book Nook.
As passionate readers we personally own an enormous collection of books.
To manage our database of books we created a program to help us store details about each of our books.

Our program comes with features such as a login and registration system that also implements face detection so the program will only run when detecting a human face.
This prevents our pet otter and squirel from randomly accessing the program by randomly pressing keys. 
It also works well in preventing robbers in ski masks from accessing our precious book data.

If you are also a passionate book collector and connoisseur this program is the perfect tool to help you organize information about each of your exquisite pieces of litterature.

Sincerly,
M & M
